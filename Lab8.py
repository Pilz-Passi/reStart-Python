# # Working with Loops
# # 1. while loop
# import random
# print("Welcome to Guess the Number!")
# print("The rules are simple. I will think of a number, and you will try to guess it.")
# # will generate a random number between 1 and 10
# number = random.randint(1,10)
# # Tracker
# isGuessRight = False
# while isGuessRight != True:
#     guess = input("Guess a number between 1 and 10: ")
#     if int(guess) == number:
#         print("You guessed {}. That is correct! You win!".format(guess))
#         isGuessRight = True
#     else:
#         print("You guessed {}. Sorry, that isnâ€™t it. Try again.".format(guess))

# 2. for loop using "range"
print("Count to 10!")
for x in range (0, 11):
